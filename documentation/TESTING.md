## Responsiveness

I made the following response tests in order to ensure that the website operates correctly and at the same time that its components are seen harmoniously 
arranged in different screen sizes, so that I used the following tools to help me.

* **Mozilla Firefox DevTools**: This browser was used to check the behavior of the web page in different screen sizes using the Developer Tools. Tests consisted in testing the appearance of the fonts used, the aspect of colors and backgrounds, the order and space used by the different elements that make up the web page.

* **Google Chrome DevTools**: This browser was used to check the behavior of the web page in different screen sizes using the Developer Tools. As in the previous browser, different tests were performed checking the aspect of the font used, colors and backgrounds, and finally, the space used by the elements of the website. In addition, a contrast was made between both browsers, checking for any existing differences.

* **Xiaomi Mi A1**: This mobile device was used to test the behavior of the website, using browsers such as *Chrome, Mozilla Firefox* and *DuckDuckGo*.

* **Xiaomi Poco x3**: This mobile device was used to test the behavior of the website, using browsers such as Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and DuckDuckGo.

* **Iphone S20**: This mobile device was used to test the behavior of the website, using browsers such as *Chrome* and *Safari*.

* **Ipad Mini 2**: This device was used to test the behavior of the website, using browsers such as *Chrome* and *Safari*.
