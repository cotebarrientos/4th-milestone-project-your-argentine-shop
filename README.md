# Your Argentine Shop
## Code Institute: Milestone Project 4

This website aims to be a 100% **E commerce Platform**, where shoppers can buy a **wide variety of Argentine products in Ireland**, whose main purpose is to make 
users feel of that nationality at home, offering quality products and providing a great service through a friendly user interface.

This project is part of my **Code Institute Full Stack Software Development** studies, and at the same time is my last project of this, so I decided to make a 
website 100% E commerce with Argentine products, using all the knowledge acquired throughout this course, hoping to bring this great idea to reality in the future.

### Design Process
---

#### Strategy Plane

Use agile design to lay the foundations of an E commerce website that is attractive to users who want to buy a product. The strategy is to 
allow users to find the products in a fast and attractive way for the customer by searching by category, price, name, etc.

Offer a variety of Argentinean products, which are not easy to find within the Republic of Ireland, but which are required or desired by
users of that nationality.

The strategy is to create an easy and intuitive to use online store, in which users can browse and find a variety of Argentinean products without problems 
or effort. In addition, the user is offered the possibility to create a profile within the website, which allows to save his/her personal data, facilitating 
the purchase through the E commerce website. It also allows to save the orders placed historically. In addition, the online store has a secure payment system.

In order to make the online store more interesting, we have also implemented a page with blog posts, with really interesting topics about the Argentinean culture.

In addition, to enhance the quality of the service offered, a review page has been implemented, where users can evaluate the service offered.

#### Scope

The scope will be to attract users by offering them simplicity and a quick search of the products offered in the online store with a fast and reliable payment, 
it will also allow them to create a profile in which they can save their personal data, orders made historically, while allowing them to access extra features 
of the website such as commenting on blog posts or leave a review evaluating the service offered.

The business user will be able to add his/her products quickly and easily, edit them or delete them when necessary. In addition the business user will be able 
to add blog posts, edit them or delete them as many times as required. He/she will also be able to moderate comments from blog posts or reviews written by the 
users of the E commerce website.

#### Structure

The site is structured to assist the user in the search for the desired product. Your Argentine Shop is an E commerce website set with the theme of the Argentine 
people, for it takes colors of the flag of this country as well as the most emblematic products and loved by all Argentine people. It also has a blog page, which 
provides interesting information about the argentine culture, arousing interest to learn more about it by users who don't necessarily belong to this country.

The website has a navigation bar with different links, it also has a logo of the website, a search bar on it, 2 icons, one for the users account and another for 
the shopping cart, and a footer that has some information and website copyright, these are the basic structures of the platform. The website has a home page, whose 
purpose is to welcome users, and every time the website is reloaded, it changes the products it displays. The online store is created to generate the desire to buy 
any product offered to the user, for this the importance of showing many images and play with nostalgia in users, since many consumers have been away from Argentina 
for a long period of time and wish to consume the products offered on the website.

#### Skeleton

The link options and drop down buttons guide the user intuitively from the home page to the product purchase stored in the database. Products stored in the database 
will drive all searches in the search bar. In addition the user will be able to sort his search by category, price, names, etc. In addition to product links, the navbar 
also contains information about the website (About Us, Shipping), a Contact page, blog and reviews.

The architecture of this website is user friendly and intuitive at the moment the client decides to make the purchase, selects a product, adjusts the shopping cart 
until the user reaches the checkout and makes the purchase. The information architecture is designed to allow rapid completion of all user objectives.

The images are stored in the AWS S3 bucket, providing a wide variety of images for the online store, and users can also add profile images, creating more identity 
when commenting on blog posts or leaving a review about the service provided.

#### Surface

In order to design the website we used elements related to the argentine culture as a reference, such as products, patriotic symbols or colors that make allusion to 
this country.

During the development process we tried to make the logo design as representative and faithful to the argentine culture as possible. For this purpose, an arduous 
research was done resulting in the creation of the current logo.

The bootstrap button and text colors were respected, signifying success, alert, warning, secondary and muted. Other colors  were also incorporated, looking to make 
the online store more diverse.

The forms were kept very simple (crispy forms were used), in some cases only with placeholders. The focus was on the information provided and required.

A modern and easy to read font was chosen, creating a user-friendly interface that was pleasing to the eye.

The most popular and loved products by Argentineans were chosen, and the most representative images were selected to create a great experience when making a purchase.

**Typography**

 2 Google fonts were used across of this website:
- Roboto
- Oswald 

### Wireframes

To make the wireframes for this project, I used Pencil software version 3.1.0. They were made as part of the design process and were saved as a pdf document 
and stored in the separate folder; wireframes. All pages are shown how the project would look like on different screen sizes (desktop, tablets and mobiles).
