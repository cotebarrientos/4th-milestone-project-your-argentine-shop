# Your Argentine Shop
## Code Institute: Milestone Project 4

This website aims to be a 100% **E commerce Platform**, where shoppers can buy a **wide variety of Argentine products in Ireland**, whose main purpose is to make users feel mainly of that nationality at home, offering quality products and providing a great service through a friendly user interface.

This project is part of my **Code Institute Full Stack Software Development** studies, and at the same time is my last project of this, so I decided to make a website 100% E commerce with Argentine products, using all the knowledge acquired throughout this course, hoping to bring this great idea to reality in the future.
